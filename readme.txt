This project is a simple blackjack game assigned as homework in the Fall 2012 Data Structures course in the University of Chicago M.S. CS Program.
To run this code, copy the hw3 directory into the src folder of a new project in your favorite Java editor (mine is Eclipse) and run the main method in BlackJackMVC.java
Alternatively, you may run the main method in BlackJackConsole.java.
Open Issues / Proposed Features:
1) Action Buttons (i.e. hit, stay, etc.) are poorly formatted. Replacing the default Java style button with a stylish icon would improve the UX
2) Game labels are poorly formatted. Same recommendation as 1.
3) The game action 'Split' was not implemented.
4) Variable betting was not implemented.
